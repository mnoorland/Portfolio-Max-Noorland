Leveraging IBM WatsonX Assistant and Generative AI, SOPHIA provides 24/7 personalized support, helping customers understand policy details and process claims efficiently. The project was presented to IBM employees at IBM Studios in Milan, demonstrating the potential of AI-driven solutions in improving customer service.
	- [Cell Image Classification Using CNNs and Hand-Crafted Features](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/finding_donors/finding_donors.ipynb): Collaborated on a project to classify electron microscope images of cells into eight distinct classes using both traditional hand-crafted features and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Utilized TensorFlow2 in Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook to build and train the models. Achieved an accuracy of approximately 90% with the CNN, outperforming the baseline model based on hand-crafted feature extraction. The project demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning in image classification tasks.
	- [Sentiment Analysis of Apple Inc. on Twitter](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/customer_segments/customer_segments.ipynb): Developed a sentiment analysis model using 2,000 tweets about Apple Inc., applying natural language processing techniques. Pre-processed the text data, tokenized and padded sequences, and trained a Random Forest Classifier to categorize tweets as positive, neutral, or negative. The project achieved an 89% accuracy, providing key insights into customer perceptions and highlighting areas for potential improvement in brand sentiment. Visualizations such as sentiment distribution and word clouds helped showcase the analysis results.
	- [Titanic Survival Prediction Using Spark MLlib](https://github.com/mnoorland/Titanic-Survival-Spark-MLlib/tree/main): Built and trained machine learning models using the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. Performed extensive data cleaning and exploratory analysis before applying Spark MLlib pipelines for classification. Tested three algorithms—Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest—with hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance. The models were evaluated and compared, achieving robust results using Spark's distributed computing capabilities.
	- [Predicting Likes on Product Reviews Using Regression Models](https://github.com/mnoorland/Review-Likes-Prediction/tree/main): Developed a machine learning model to predict the number of likes on product reviews for Yojo.com, using a dataset of 28,000 reviews. The model utilized various textual features, such as word count, sentiment, and subjectivity, and applied regression techniques to forecast the popularity of reviews. After performing data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering, several regression algorithms were tested, and the best model was selected based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) performance. The project provided insights into how textual characteristics influence customer engagement with reviews.
	- [Time Series Forecasting of Energy Consumption and Stock Volatility](https://github.com/mnoorland/Time-Series-Forecasting-Energy-Stock/tree/main): Conducted time series analysis on fossil fuel consumption and stock volatility using ARIMA, VAR, and GARCH models. Modelled total fossil fuel consumption with ARIMA, incorporating seasonal patterns, and compared it with a VAR model that included economic indicators such as GDP and Industrial Production Index. For stock volatility, applied a GARCH model to Tesla stock returns to forecast future volatility. The project showcased advanced forecasting techniques in energy and finance sectors.

- ### Data Analysis and Visualization

	- [Bicycle Manufacturer Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/sajal2692/disaster-message-classifier): Developed an interactive dashboard for a bicycle manufacturer to analyse top-selling products, year-over-year performance, and product category sales. Utilized Power BI for data visualization, SQL for ETL processes, and PowerPoint for presentation. The dashboard enabled the manufacturer to easily identify key products and trends, providing actionable insights to drive sales strategy.
